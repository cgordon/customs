Sword Coast Customs

# About

Baldur's Gate has two powerful weapons with elemental damage enchantments: Ashideena and Varscona. Both weapons are
available early in the campaign and remain best-in-class until the end of the game. This mod allows the player to
craft one equally powerful melee weapon with acid, electric, fire or frost damage, by working with Taerom at the
Thunderhammer Smithy, Thalantyr at the High Hedge and Halbazzer at Sorcerous Sundries. Optionally, the mod will either
remove Ashideena and Varscona from the game entirely, or move them to be found later in the game.

# Installation

Sword Coast Customs makes use of Weidu for installation, and there is an excellent overview on the Baldur's Gate forums
for how to install mods into Baldur's Gate:

# Compatibility

This mod has only been tested with Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition 2.6.6 in a vanilla installation. I have made every
attempt to keep the installation minimally invasive, but it is likely that the mod will not work correctly for non-EE
versions of the game.

There is no content in this mod for Baldur's Gate II or Throne of Bhaal.

# Components

## Core Component

The core component makes these modifications:

1. Taerom Fuiruim, at the Thunderhammer Smithy in Beregost, will offer to craft the player a masterwork weapon after they have suitably impressed him.
2. Thalantyr, at the High Hedge west of Beregost, will be able to imbue the masterwork weapon with elemental damage (a +1 enchantment bonus).
3. Halbazzer Drin, at Sorcerous Sundries in Baldur's Gate, will be able to enhance the weapon (a +2 enchantment bonus).

Taerom will only craft melee weapons, so slings, short bows, long bows, crossbows and darts are not available. The mod
will install new artwork for the weapons (18 masterwork weapons, 4 of each at +1 enchantment, 4 of each at +2 enchantment,
so 162 total weapons).

## Remove or relocate Ashideena and Varscona

This is an optional component to remove or relocate Ashideena and Varscona to later in the game. It is already a little
over-balanced to have two elemental weapons that early in the game, so adding a third may be seen as going too far. This
gives the player the option to remove the existing elemental weapons entirely, so their new weapon reigns supreme, or to
relocate the weapons into Baldur's Gate, so they appear at a more appropriate time in the development of the character.

mod wouldn't be possible without all the questions and patient answers on those forums.
