@2001=~Can you imbue a weapon with magical properties to aid me in my battles?~
@2002=~Without a suitable weapon to enchant, I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for you at this time. Perhaps you can convince Taerom Fuiruim to craft you a masterwork weapon worth enchanting. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have more pressing matters to attend to.~
@2003=~Taerom has crafted me a mastwork weapon, can you imbue it with magical properties?~
@2005=~Never mind, I've changed my mind.~
@2006=~I can imbue your weapon with the power of acid, fire, cold, or electrical energy. Once my enchantment takes hold, each time the weapon strikes a foe, it shall inflict additional damage of the chosen element.~
@2007=~I would prefer acid damage.~
@2008=~I would prefer cold damage.~
@2009=~I would prefer fire damage.~
@2010=~I would prefer electrical damage.~
@2011=~Ahem, I'm afraid your current financial situation is inadequate for the services I provide, traveler. The enchantments I offer are of the highest quality and imbued with immense power, thus, they come at a price that only those with substantial wealth can afford. I do not work for meager coin or mere trinkets, for my expertise in the arcane is invaluable and beyond compare.~
@2012=~Enchanting a weapon with a powerful magical effect is no easy task, and requires extensive knowledge of the arcane and the finest materials. If you seek my services, it will cost 2,000 gold to imbue your weapon with frost. Would you like me to proceed?~
@2013=~Enchanting a weapon with a powerful magical effect is no easy task, and requires extensive knowledge of the arcane and the finest materials. If you seek my services, it will cost 2,000 gold to imbue your weapon with acid. Would you like me to proceed?~
@2014=~Enchanting a weapon with a powerful magical effect is no easy task, and requires extensive knowledge of the arcane and the finest materials. If you seek my services, it will cost 2,000 gold to imbue your weapon with electricity. Would you like me to proceed?~
@2015=~Enchanting a weapon with a powerful magical effect is no easy task, and requires extensive knowledge of the arcane and the finest materials. If you seek my services, it will cost 2,000 gold to imbue your weapon with fire. Would you like me to proceed?~
@2016=~Yes, please proceed.~
@2017=~I do not have that much gold.~
