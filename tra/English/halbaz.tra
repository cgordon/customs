@3001=~Can you enhance the freezing aura on my enchanted weapon?~
@3002=~Can you enhance the corrosive effect of my enchanted weapon?~
@3003=~Can you enhance the shocking effect of my enchanted weapon?~
@3004=~Can you enhance the burning aura on my enchanted weapon?~
@3005=~I am certain that you will find many excellent ways to enrich yourselves in the grand city of Baldur's Gate. I am equally certain that you will find no one better equipped to enhance your enchanted weapon, so come back when you have the funds necessary to continue.~
@3006=~Ah, this looks like the work of Taerom Fuiruim, whose skill I have long admired. The enchantment doesn't look as impressive, perhaps it is from that insufferable hedge mage Thalantyr? No matter, it will be no great strain for me to improve upon it, but it will require expensive materials, so I cannot do it for any less than 4,000 gold. Would you like me to proceed?~
@3007=~It appears that I do not currently have the funds.~
@3008=~Never mind, I've changed my mind.~
@3009=~Yes, proceed.~
